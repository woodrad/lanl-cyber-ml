# Summary

4-6 sentences summarizing the most important aspects of your model and analysis, such as:

    How you spent your time (Eg. what proportion on feature engineering vs. machine learning?)
    Your most important insight into the data
    The most important features
    The training method(s) you used
    The tool(s) you used

# Features Selection / Extraction

    What were the most important features? *
    How did you select features?
    Did you make any important feature transformations?
    Did you find any interesting interactions between features?
    Did you use external data?

*We suggest you provide:

    a variable importance plot showing the 10-20 most important features and
    partial plots for the 3-5 most important features

If this is not possible, you should provide a list of the most important features.

# Training Method(s)

    What training methods did you use?
    Did you ensemble the models?
    If you did ensemble, how did you weight the different models?

# Simple Features and Methods

Many customers are happy to trade off model performance for simplicity. With this in mind:

    Is there a subset of features that would get 90-95% of your final performance? Which features? *
    What model that was most important? *
    What would the simplified model score?

*Try and restrict your simple model to fewer than 10 features and one training method.

# Interesting findings

    What was the most important trick you used?
    What do you think set you apart from others in the competition?
    Did you find any interesting relationships in the data that don't fit in the sections above.
